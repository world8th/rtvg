Ray-tracing based vector graphics renderer (alternate of nanoVG)

## What we can do with this?

Ray-traced vector graphics can gift some possibilities, which you hasn't been:

- Elegant DPI scaling solution instead of re-rendering everything from zero
- Use same geometry data for every draw call
- Partial transformation and partial hierarchy rebuilding
- Unique effects, such as partial vector scaling of scene (or part of), or backdrop blurs
- Eliminate pixels as is...

## In far future...

I believe that will best solution for Linux-based systems... It can avoid patent problems with Aero, make simpler some Microsoft design and ideomatic ideas.
